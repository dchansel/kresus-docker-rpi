; Kresus for the first time.

; Overriden by the KRESUS_DIR environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; datadir=/home/ben/.kresus

; to expose it on port 80 directly but to use a reverse-proxy
; configuration like Nginx, Caddy or Apache.
; Can be removed; defaults to "9876".
; Overriden by the PORT environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:

; subdomain.
